<h1> Machine Learning with Pyspark</h1>

<p>Apache Spark, once a component of the Hadoop ecosystem, is now becoming the big-data platform of choice for enterprises. It is a powerful open source engine that provides real-time stream processing, interactive processing, graph processing, in-memory processing as well as batch processing with very fast speed, ease of use and standard interface.</p>

<p> In this project a simple Regression with Machine Learning is performed using various regression algorithms.</b>
<p>The dataset which I have used is of Housing prices.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The data is related with housing prices. The regression goal is to predict median housing price</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The operations done on dataset are:

* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Machine learning algorithms to train and predict</p>
